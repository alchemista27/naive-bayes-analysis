Saleema Jo,"Did exactly what I needed it to do!!!! Personal time is back to normal vs all the limitations (if you know you know). The only thing I would say is that it lags my device in both operations and internet. However, I am on the free version and am guessing that there's a better connection after upgrading. I'm very much considering making the purchase. Thank you so much for providing a free version of this app Turbo!!!!",5,2024-03-01 18:34:40
Saul Delgado,This has been a really really great service. It's so great one time several years they provided me with internet service even while my phone ü§≥ was cut off and the bill was overdue. It was a magical experience really. Only time it ever disconnected was when my battery died. Every time it died somehow I'll still able to reconnect. but if it kept dying Then I only had myself to blame. I would give 6 stars if possible.,5,2024-03-15 13:24:57
Raven Elise,"The free version works well for me. The one ad is usually basically nothing; very rarely i get one that I have to sit through for 30 seconds or that is annoying to get out of, but the frequency of those is NOTHING compared to other free apps. I'm in a rural area so wifi isn't the fastest, but it still runs pretty quickly with this VPN as opposed to others. What I don't like is that it kicks me off sometimes without me realizing it for a while. We all love chasing rabbits, right?",5,2024-02-15 03:16:12
JJ Castro,"Customer service has really impressed me with their attentiveness and commitment to solve all and any issue that comes up. With my yearly subscription I don't get any ads at all. I decided to go ahead and read what is done with my data. Update: I have been reassured of the no-log policy . So, the app does NOT collect my data. The app keeps disconnecting, even though I've followed instructions on how to have it always on.",5,2024-02-15 05:07:53
chevelle olivarez,"For anyone writing a review about the long ads, you realize you can exit the app as soon as it's connected and just swipe up and clear - and it'll still be connected without you having watched it - same way with disconnecting, it pops up an ad and i just close and reopen the app and then ad isn't there. Been using this app since 2019.",5,2024-02-14 08:15:30
Keith Harris,"Paid for the subscription, speed increased slightly, however i needed to change payment methods and their 'support' is an endless circle of automated responses and no assistance whatsoever. If you pay from anywhere other than Google, youll have to close the bank account in order to change/stop payments. They will continue to charge you and ignore your requests. I have 20 emails to and from them, all automated, none contain assistance.",1,2024-03-11 12:35:49
Sarah Parker,"I signed up for a trial, as OFFERED through the Play store. It didn't give me the trial, but automatically charged me for a full year! If already had trial, should have been informed so!! As soon as I saw this charge(immediately after), I cancelled the subscription&requested a refund, explaining what happened. I didn't open the app or use it at all(still haven't to this day). My refund request was denied&told to contact the app developer. I did so, and they told me it was a Play Store issue.",1,2024-02-29 01:28:32
Danielle ‚ÄúKeela‚Äù Brickhouse,"I have been using this VPN app for awhile. I find that I generally have issues with this app running in the background. I have changed all my system settings to prioritize this app over others and still keep having issues with it shutting down instead of running. I have found that the most secure location for me personally has been in Germany, though it looks like with this latest update, has been taken down leaving only the one you have to pay for. This app is useless if you don't buy services.",2,2023-11-03 02:48:55
mike mike,Ive updated the app and my opinion hasnt changed. The extremely long commercials is unbelievable. Enough so that i can no longer tolerate using this app... DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP The length of the commercials is ridiculous half the time you cant even click the X at the end to close it. Furthermore the servers are super slow and lag down your phone most of the time.,1,2023-12-21 05:22:28
S H,"Excellent.One of the most fair VPN applications out there. I did rate it 5 stars, which they deserve...I would like to see more connection options concerning security. The tunneling is fair but it should include system applications with an ability to analyze the APK's , SHA checks for authenticity in the sys. Plus a built in scanning procedure, to check against network changes on the ISP mobile side for security enhancing. Good luck guys & gals, excellent job.",5,2023-12-21 13:45:34
A Google user,"Good VPN, works well, gives you better connection, but there's so many ads including outside the app. Whenever I leave an app or open an app a pop up ad will come up. I understand that you need to pay to keep your app up and stuff and that's perfectly fine, but maybe let the user know that there will be ads. Good overall, but the ads are excessive. But the VPN part is good, it works, and it does it job. But maybe do a little change to the ads.:)",2,2018-10-24 22:27:32
Amtemeri,"This is a good VPN. But it has two problems worth mentioning. 1: Discord VCs don't work. Messages are fine, but joining a VC is impossible. I believe this is due to Turbo VPN not using a UDP (User Datagram Protocol) which is required for Discord VCs. 2: Ads. I get it's a free app but there has to be a limit. You get an ad EVERY TIME you open the app and turn on/off the VPN. It makes the app feel monotonous to use. It doesn't bother me, but I know that ads may be a dealbreaker for a lot of users.",3,2022-12-19 23:04:00
A Google user,"Video ads with audio = instant uninstall. Edit: Yes developer, I am well aware how modern software is monetized on mobile devices. Most of your ads are simple page splash, with no live video or sound. However, sometimes the videos come on, and never again.

A Google user,"I had used Turbo VPN for a long time, as it seemed pretty good. Unfortunately, I eventually noticed the that once you've been connected for an hour or two, they start throttling your connection to 0.5 Mb/s, which isn't too bad. But the fact that they throttle your connection is what drove me to find a better one. P.S. One can assume that if you buy the vip you'll not be throttled, but I ain't paying.",2,2019-09-11 12:00:16
P. Luis Ocasio,"EDIT: So they've deprecated or removed the number of locations (India, Singapore, etc.). The ads however make it just extremely hard to use. If I connect to a site, go to an app and the app won't connect, in order for me to go back to the VPN app, I have to watch an ad, just to check the connectivity. Lame. Extremely annoying when time is of the essence. Again... I used the subscription service but found it a hefty cost for the features; and now with less sites it just isn't great.",2,2023-01-17 22:18:22
A Google user,"Been using this successfully for a couple of months. Works well most of the time. But starting last week and coinciding with the latest update the app won't connect at all. Instead a pop up appears warning of counterfeit software with a link to the play store, where the options are to uninstall or to run the app. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but that didn't help.",3,2019-10-07 20:25:04
Joy Tan,"I used this app for quite a long time. About 1 and a half years. It never crashed, never disconnected or anything. This was my go to VPN. There were a lot of ads but that was okay. However, right now, the speed keeps on slowing down and I have no choice but to eventually disconnect it everytime. I tried almost all the countries but to no avail:/",2,2021-03-25 01:36:39
A Google user,"Turbo VPN is one of the best free VPN's I have found. That said, it's still an unreliable piece of garbage that will occasionally decide to not work approximately once a week. Pros: High speeds on certain servers Very secure Free! Cons: Will frequently give you a ""no network found error"", making app unusable Will automatically disconnect after a bit if the server is manially chosen High speed unreliable and often requires connection restarts Almost certainly giving your data to China",2,2019-06-02 15:01:30
A Google user,"Honest review: while I cannot say that this is the best Free VPN out there, but it definitely gets the job done most of the time ( cause there'll be time where you encounter server not being able to get any connection.) But, eventually you will gets it after trying it a few more time ( or tap repair). I'm on vacation in China this November(2018) and realized that using my own data to browse the ""Western"" webpages or watch YouTube or using any other services is simply not good enough(cause the speed simply can't pull it off). And while connect to the local WiFi also won't allow to do any of the things that I've mentioned above, and that I knew that I should've install a Free VPN app before my visit. But I'm glad that I found this app in the play store and it works just fine. But, I think there's a slight problem with the app, it may consume quite much power(which it is not quite good to use outside unless you have a power bank with you most of the time).",4,2018-11-30 13:45:05
A Google user,"Great app! It works well and free servers work fast. Occasionally, they are a tad bit slow, but they are free. I just found out if you pull down past your notifications (where you see Wi-Fi settings, Flash Light, DND, etc.), it'll tell you, ""Device connected to Turbo VPN."" If you tap on ""Device connected to Turbo VPN,"" there's an option called, ""Always-On VPN."" Turning that setting on will make your VPN connection more stable. I just turned it on for my Essential Phone. Edit: Uh, ok, then...?",4,2019-04-13 22:20:47
Victor Salazar Martinez,"Like many VPN's, paying for the service actually makes the service 300x better. The free version has a long boot-up time on the chrome laptops, but when it's up and running has decent speeds. However, once I paid for the one month experience, it went from 5kb to 15-16kb speeds. For many others, that might not be very significant, but to me who uses school wifi and still trying to access his favorite sights? Well, it's a major difference.",4,2022-06-09 05:16:13
A Google user,"The application is very easy to use. However, a user's ability to remain anonymous is severely flawed due to many DNS leaks and poor encryption methods (maybe that's why the VPN can connect in less than two seconds). What's the point in using a VPN that does not protect my digital footprints from my ISP? I understand that the service is free, but please focus a little more on your network security. Thank you.",3,2019-03-26 12:31:36
Aksam Rafiz,"At first when I got it last year it was fantastic, speed was decent and you had a couple of servers to choose from. They also had ads but they never hindered my experience but fast forward to the present their situation has deteriorated since then, the app is filled with ads, it will bombard in ur face and u can't do anything but wait till it's over. More over, the speed has gone down too, no longer is it possible to surf properly. Goodbye turbo, you were good while u lasted.",3,2020-08-18 01:17:42
A Google user,This works fine as a VPN. However the free version is so clogged with ads I didn't even want to try it long enough to consider paying for VIP. You already have banner ads. Why would you have video ads run (at max volume I might add) every time I switch back to the app on top of ads that run after you connect to a new location? That's overkill and really frustrating and off-putting.,2,2020-03-04 02:30:38
A Google user,"WAY TOO MANY ADS TO EVEN USE! If you need to check emails, great. Stream a video? Not so much! While watching a video at first it streams very well, great on buffer speed then it stops due to an ad! ü§î Then you have to skip the ad on this ap then go back to the streaming video and start it over. Oh by the way, you CANNOT fast forward the video without causing yet another ad to pop up on this VPN. KINDA POINTLESS!!!",1,2018-10-25 10:14:11
A Google user,"It's okay for VPN standards, does what it is told and is very basic. The problem? Constant closing, it's a weak VPN from my experience.

I recommend Hoxx VPN on Firefox for anyone reading this wanting another alternative.",2,2019-08-03 01:39:05
A Google user,"Saves my head from exploding on a regular basis. Made a BAD carrier switch recently which made my S7 edge practically useless. Google Play refused to update any of my apps, which can make ones head explode when your livelihood depends on your calendar app and your email app actually functioning properly. Tried several VPNs & by far the fastest connection, with stable, fast servers has by far been Turbo VPN. Google Play behaves itself & I don't have to wait all day for my updates to download. Thus my head, and my phone, remain intact. Thanks Devs! Solid FREE app. Well done! & Well worth a subscription for the extra features! Cheers!",5,2018-10-14 07:38:00
Kristyna,"Great free VPN app that is easy to connect and offers a login option to save certain settings. It allows other features with the free version. Pretty cool.

Ronald Ziehm,"***ACTUALLY*** 4.5 STARS I don't often rate anything, unless it is astoundingly terrible, or amazingly superb. And this time it is the latter of the two. I paid the nominal couple of dollars for the premium version, and it has almost exceeded my expectations. I even had to get a replacement phone from at&t and couldn't get anything from my old destroyed device, but I re-downloaded app, and still got premium version. Only issue is several locations are permanently full even though I pay for them!",4,2020-10-29 12:24:59
Meta Ze Gr8,Turbo VPN is far from perfect. There's a scammy ad that occasionally shows up in the app and tries to trick you into installing another one of the developers' apps; and that ad covers the whole app screen and doesn't go away until you shut it down from your recent apps menu and then restart it. This is in addition to the app occasionally freezing when on a black screen when trying to display a video ad.,3,2023-07-12 20:35:09
Collin,"If I could give a 0 I would. DO NOT use this app. They offer a ""free"" service that hardly works. You're lucky if it works at all. They have a premium option that you can use, but you can only purchase it yearly, not on a month to month basis. They throttle and show false up and down speeds when in app, but as soon as you close the app. You lose over 85% of the up and down speed. They intentionally throttle you to purchase the premium. Also, they put the blame on you when it doesn't ""work"".",1,2022-06-16 22:52:05
Krista Stovall,"I've been using Turbo VPN for about 2 weeks now and I have to say that it is a all around great app! The interface is easy to use and I have been thinking about upgrading to premium. The free version has everything I need, only takes a few seconds to connect, doesn't have any adverse effects on my phone or battery life, and consistently reliable I am curious what the relatively cheap premium subscription can do! If you need a quality easy to use VPN the Turbo VPN is a great choice.",5,2021-09-02 21:16:06
A Google user,"Ok so.. so far I've been using it for about a month. It works phenomenal and doesn't bug you with ads as you use your browser or whatever app you're using. (Which is automatic 4+ stars) It is also has fast activation which starts your VPN within seconds. I really like the fact that the ads are only in the app itself, like I said before. Overall, really good, trustworthy, high rated in reviews, so you cant go wrong. Happy VPNing",5,2019-08-26 11:45:22
A Google user,I like this app alot & it works well even in free version. I wish I could afford the paid version but where I am located I can not afford it because the cost of living expense per person is to high. With 2 kids that use my phone to play games having a dependable VPN is important to me and that you offer. Only problem is thay like to click on the adds when they have to connect. Anyway good job I appreciate your service & hard work :-),5,2018-10-22 07:09:27
Riza Dolam,The app needs improvements still. As a IT manager here is my honest opinion. Its a good vpn with good speed but sometimes it shows that it's connected when it's not . Plus the auto connect is very bad in the app. If you switch internet it won't auto connect even if you switch the auto connect feature on. I like this app and I bought the gold membership because I believe this app can be better. Don't disappoint me and try to make some improvements.,2,2022-08-16 13:54:18
hummus crow,"It used to be better. Recently they made it free a LOT more limited. Time is now limited, your connection gets slower if you don't watch adds.

Monica McIntosh,Updating my previous review. I was able to correct the problem with signing into my account and having it show as a paid subscription. I did make a second attempt to contact the developer and actually recieved a response this time. I figured out that my account needed to be reset before I had any conversation with them. Not sure why my account suddenly needed a reset as I use it all the time. I also agree that over time the ads have increased.Fewer ads when you pay should be the rule .,2,2021-10-17 20:37:59

David Garcia,Pretty good vpn so far. Only been few days but can't complain. Speeds seem to be good and lots of location to choose from. One issue I have is it disconnecting from vpn when I go afk for a lil bit. I'm sure this is a user issue by me and I haven't looked hard enough to change the settings. I'm spoiled and never had that be a issue with other vpn services I used. Pricing seems to be competitive also. Will update after 1 week free trial is finished.,4,2023-03-08 10:51:31
Steven Middleman,"Previous rating deleted. (Says free but asks for money) New: Re-rated from 1 star to 4. Here's the problem. When you install and boot it up, the first thing it does... is ask you to subscribe. This gives the impression that it's not free :/ If you close and re-open.. You'll find that SOME of the countries are, indeed, free. Being presented up front with payment options was a huge turn off when the app name has the word ""free"" in it. That's my ""critique""",4,2020-07-22 23:05:23
A R,"Used to be a lot better. Now, it won't even let me disconnect without watching an ad, and worst is that the ads don't close when you press the X. I don't think i can use this anymore.

I tried the 7 day premium package and I could not even connect to a US server even after hours of attempts.

Clarence ‚ÄúBear‚Äù Barnes,Aight look. This mofo work. And is free. Now I will say it tricked me into thinking it was paid. So when you down load it. And open it up. You will see a prompt to pay for subscription. It's purely voluntary. Look for the almost impossible to see X. Too left or right. Click to connect and bam. Add always on and enjoy my boy or girl or other. I'm in Florida. Wait I'm in Amsterdam.üíØ,5,2024-01-26 05:54:38

anubhav tiwari,"I had been using this app from last 5 years but due to my recent experience, now i have to look for other options.

Nawaz Ahmed,"I wish there is an option not to give even one star. 1. You take gold subscription, the app keeps recommending you to upgrade to platinum. 2.

Althought I don't understand for what reason anyone use VPN other than this.! 4. Pathetic customer service. They always close the ticket without resolution. 5. No refund. Better go for other VPN.",1,2023-12-17 17:13:21
Tamara Laws (Harleyque0420),I deleted the app because I didn't want to keep my subscription after the trial however I just had money taken out of my account for the service instead of the trial ending and it took the last few dollars I had left to buy a few groceries to last me through the week. I need to speak to a csr ASAP about this and have the charges reversed as I have redownloaded the app JUST to cancel the subscription since it didn't cancel initially like I had asked for it to be when deleting the first time.,1,2023-12-22 17:40:31

The subscription was taken only for a month. Kindly understand the timeline of the situation and help resolve this issue ASAP.",3,2021-01-02 02:53:49
Zubin Ronnie,"Its a great app even with the ads. Wide range of options and as far as I can see, decent semantics. But one big issue, because of which I can't give a full 5 stars, is because they routinely send ads through notifications and these ads are lewd or NSFW (before you ask, I only use the VPN to change my Spotify or Netflix location and don't surf adult sites) which is not a good thing when your phone is always open or on and other people use it. Please fix immediately.",3,2021-12-27 17:39:40
Mud Rain,"Used it for search and downloads for several years now. After connecting, ads stop, not sure why people complain, ads are only appearing during initial connection or change of servers.

However, the last 2 years, I've been using Turbo - It's amazing! Everything goes smooth and easy. The user interface is simple and easily manageable. Another thing, the premium feature is not an absolute necessity. Unlike other VPNs, you have to pay for full access. Their free trails are bad. I recommend Turbo VPN a solid 5/5. Highly recommended and trustable.",5,2019-04-17 04:57:58
Flyinkuro,"I've used this app for more than 2 years, it was honestly the best free vpn out there (I've tried and tested many, this one was the best). Until recently. The latest update requires you to upgrade to premium to remove the time limit and have stable connection. Sometimes you can't connect at all while other times you can. I feel like I'm being forced to upgrade to premium when in the older version I have the freedom whether to upgrade or not. Don't download. There are better free vpns out there.",1,2021-11-30 21:58:54

Thank you very much for resolving the issues! Looking forward to more improvements",4,2022-04-28 22:36:21
Hajira Asaf Khan,"The app starts out fine but after a while, the number of ads becomes excessive. To the point where as soon as you leave the app screen, your phone no longer detects an Internet connection. A notification will tell you to change the location to 'fix' the issue. The notification directs you back to the app where an already prompted ad will start playing. Connection resumed once you've watched the ad. And then the same process repeats. Really terrible.",1,2021-10-04 01:33:07
DAISUKI -,"The app work just fine. But sometimes it has a time limit for the download speed while streaming. Whenever it reached 2minutes, the connection was decreased and running on 0k/s. Before it happens, it can run >1m/s. Idk, but I tried to reconnect, then it works again but it's just same. I had to disconnect and reconnect it every 2 minutes, that's so annoying.

A Google user,"I kinda like this VPN since It's simple and easy to use. Perfect for someone who just need a quick or regular VPN session. However lately, when trying to quick connect, sometimes the loading is very slow and in the end just failed. I have to manually select the server to connect quickly. What's frustrating me is there isn't a cancel option when quick connect. So I got to wait and watch the loading until the end that just results in failure. Ohh and what's with the long app startup?",3,2019-10-19 21:59:25
Nishant Sankhe,I had have been using Turbo VPN for over a year now. Had rated it 5/5. It had high amount speed and less ads. Now it has crawling speeds and high amount of ads. Especially hate it when I can't go 1 click(tap) without an ad. Worst is when the connection is slow so I try to change servers. I spend more time going through ads than I end up actually spending on the internet. 1 star. Uninstalling.,1,2023-04-16 19:15:13
Phillip Dashkevich,"It's very slow, nearly halts my internet speeds. It's also swarmed with ads. I get it, revenue is needed to be generated or go pro.

Also an ad, when you open it from background, an ad when you try to disconnect and another one after you disconnect. Most of free servers are unavailable, and you cannot connect to them, you can only connect to the server chosen by default, and the speed is too slow even to just open simple pages.

ahmed mifzal,"I started using the app pretty recently and to be honest, compared to other apps i really like the simple design of the app and also it is not too difficult to use either. So far, i havent come across any issues yet",5,2024-01-08 05:32:35

Jerem Pontillas,This is the vpn that actually works. Too bad it needs a faster internet connection for me to use it. I still do recommend to download the app,4,2024-02-22 01:22:11
Kevin Fernando,Such a wonderful app. So exited about it and It finds the nearest best server rapidly. And It have secure also. So I recommend this app for other Android devices and make your internet using more safteier .,5,2024-01-04 15:16:30

A Google user,"This app is astonishing! Real smooth and small MB size as well! The connection was terrible in the past but thanks to the update, it's perfect. I have a small suggestion though:When I connect to a server, would it be possible to add feature where I could just disconnect from the server using the notifications area since the ""VPN Connected to the Server"" appears in the notifications area whenever I connected to VPN? (Totally NOT because im too lazy to open the app again just to disconnect LOL XD)",5,2019-09-13 19:58:12
Joanne Vincentius,"Issues: 1. Ads It's completely understandable if the app has ads since it's a free app, but it seriously needs to tone down the amount of ads there are. Every single tap causes an ad to pop up and it is seriously annoying. I would have been able to put up with it, BUT 2. IT DOESN'T WORK. The app doesn't even work things that are not available in my country are still not available after turning the VPN on. („Éº_„Éº„Çõ) honestly disappointed.",1,2021-06-28 12:30:21
